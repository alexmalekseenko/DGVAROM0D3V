! This file contains parameter setting for Data Driven Boltzmann module
!
! DO NOT CHANGE THE PARAMETER NAMES! INTEGERS are limited to 6 digits! 
!
!
! "," is a separator, IMPORTANT: ",4" will be read as two numbers, "0" and "4"
! "." is the decimal point
!  
! parameter description (name) must not change including no adding extra spaces between words! 
! 
! the parameter description ends with  "=" whish is followed by the parameter value
! 
! the program will ignore all lines that start with "!"
!

name sol file read  =        Mach4      ! name_solutions_file_read  name of the file to read the solutions from 

!!!
name sing vec file read = SpHom100Trim0SVs_SVZeroBasisReadFort ! svdname name of the file where singular vectors are recorded. 
use SV Zero basis =  yes ! flag_SVZeroBasisInUse yes is using SV zero basis otherwise no. Yes will cause to look for linear kernel

!!!
header s vec kernel file = SVZeroCln100M41Tr0SVKrnlk65Opt ! SVKrnl_name name of a file where Collision kernel of SVD decomposition is stored. Can be stored in chunkcs, then _ch00X will be added to the name
first entry svkernel     = 1                          ! si_start the index of the first record to read or write into the file SVKrnl_name

header SVzr lin ker file = SVZeroCln100M41Tr0KrnlP5   ! DO Not include "_BKrnl.dat" part.  SVLinKrnl_name name of the file where Linearized Kernel is kept -- is used with the SVzero basis
number of svkernel chunks = 1                         ! num_SVKernl_chnks components of the sing. vect. kernel may be recorded in several files in chunks. each chunk will be designated by _ch00X added to the name 
target size ROM basis   = 35                          ! k_tgt -- the target size of the ROM basis. Can use k_end instead of basing it on entries of SVKernel Array
